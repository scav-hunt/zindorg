  <h4 id="who-is-zindorg">Who is Zindorg?</h4>

  <p>Zindorg is an ancient creature who created the earth. Pursued by other beings across the universe, he sought refuge in our galaxy and created planet earth as a refuge. Zindorg buried himself deep in the earth where he has been in a submerged state ever since. Zindorg has many powers. The sacred teachings tell us that Zindorg will awaken one day and return only when the Great FireBall arrives. This event will mark the end of the world and beginning of the new one.</p>

  <h4 id="can-i-commune-with-zindorg">Can I commune with Zindorg?</h4>

  <p>Even though Zindorg is asleep we can commune with him by transcending to the spiritual plane! Zindorg’s spirit is active in the SubLime. The SUbLime is an elevated state of being - it is described as being like a mix between Nirvana and being in an Ikea on Labor Day. To learn more about how to commune with Zindorg, we encourage you to visit us in person for meditation services and how-to guides.</p>

  <h4 id="what-does-zindorg-look-like">What does Zindorg look like?</h4>

  <p>Zindorg has not yet been directly observed by human eyes, though we are able to commune with him in the SubLime. Below is an artist’s rendering, though no mere mortal could hope to capture the true grandeur that is Zindorg.</p>
