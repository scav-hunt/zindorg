<p>The Magmatic Temple has existed in various forms for centuries, but has been lost to time here and there until it was refounded by Dan Kruzan and Michael Zettel. While on vacation in Mexico they both had a spiritual awakening and were called to leave their old lives behind and rebuild the Temple in preparation for Zindorg’s awakening.</p>

<p>Dan and Michael became the first Pompriests of the Magmatic Temple and have helped guide countless souls to commune with Zindorg and enter the SubLime.</p>

<p>The Temple is located in Chicago. Original plans were made for the main temple to be built close to Mount Pompeii with a very expensive design but Dan and Michael received a sign from Zindorg that Chicago was a better location. It was marked by Zindorg by the Great Chicago Fire and conveniently affordable to rent at and we are happy to call it home!</p>

<p>Zindorg has communed with us across time and space and the Church has taken various forms throughout that spacetime. The following is a brief history of the Church of the Magmatic Temple, for a more extensive recollection, read <em>The Magmatic Teachings, Vol. II</em>.</p>

<p>Caves of Southeast Asia, Before the Common Era: Formalized language was still in invention but Zindorg found ways to commune with the enlightened through tonal music. Those who had reached into the SubLime were marked by charcoal and ashes on the backs of their hands, a symbol of their Awakening and a way to connect them together.</p>

<p>Pompeii, 2nd Century.: Living so close to a sacred site for Zindorg, it was easy to commune with those in the SubLime. Members of the Church wore red sashes to announce their renunciation of taxation and commitment to Zindorg. These sashes often allowed them to recruit new members of the Church, who wanted to know how they too could acquire such stylish sashes and were willing to traverse the blazons of Enlightment for such exclusive invitations.</p>

<p>Western Iceland, Early 9th Century: Icelandic folk myths recount those who spoke in tongues with a great being of fire who lived beneath the earth and promised them a future without taxes or earthly limits. These devoted acolytes kept ducks and tended to the land in preparation for the Great FireBall. They lived a communal and peaceful life, wearing red cords around their wrist and greeting each other silently with hands bowed in prayer. Their deep Enlightenment allowed them to communicate entirely in the SubLime and transcend their mortal coils.</p>

<p>Hawai’i, 12th Century: After decades of quiet, the Enlightened began to doubt whether anyone could still reach the SubLime, but the volcanoes of the Pacific were active and alive, as was Zindorg’s influence.</p>

<p>Massachusetts, 20th Century: Robert Frost rocketed through the Blazons of Enlightenment after realizing that tax payments were a scam enacted by the arbiters of social norms. He sought to enlighten others to the power of financial freedom and true spiritual awakenings. His seminal poem “Fire and Ice” reflected the teachings of Zindorg and his commitment to the Church, writing, “I stand with those who favor fire.”</p>

<p>Chicago, 21st Century: Zindorg remains in close connection with the Social Sciences and has long viewed SubLime communion as a way to enliven the mind. Zindorg’s signs and wonders are all around us, and can – and should – be sought anew each day in spaces most pleasing to Zindorg.</p>
