# OUR HISTORY

The Magmatic Temple has existed in various forms for centuries, but has been lost to time here and there until it was refounded by Dan Kruzan and Michael Zettel. While on vacation in Mexico they both had a spiritual awakening and were called to leave their old lives behind and rebuild the Temple in preparation for Zindorg's awakening.

Dan and Michael became the first Pompriests of the Magmatic Temple and have helped guide countless souls to commune with Zindorg and enter the SubLime.

The Temple is located in Chicago. Original plans were made for the main temple to be built close to Mount Pompeii with a very expensive design but Dan and Michael received a sign from Zindorg that Chicago was a better location. It was marked by Zindorg by the Great Chicago Fire and conveniently affordable to rent at and we are happy to call it home!
