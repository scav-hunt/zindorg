Greetings! You have unearthed the Sign of P훮hoehoe! Members of this Blazon signify themselves by pointing downwards when they encounter the sigil of Zindorg. Those who have unlocked the Sign of P훮hoehoe are invited to gather with us at the Point at 7am on Sunday the 5th of May when we partake in a great communion with Zindorg!
