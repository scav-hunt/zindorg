# Pyroclastic Sign

Greetings! You have unearthed the Pyroclastic Sign! Members of this Blazon signify themselves by wearing a red string around their right wrist. Those who have unlocked the Pyroclastic Sign are invited to gather with us at the Point at 7am on Sunday the 5th of May when we partake in a great communion with Zindorg!
