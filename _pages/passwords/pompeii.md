# Lahar Sign

Greetings! You have unearthed the Lahar Sign! Members of this Blazon signify themselves by wearing a black thread tied around their shoelace. Those who have unlocked the Lahar Sign are invited to gather with us at the Point at 7am on Sunday the 5th of May when we partake in a great communion with Zindorg!
