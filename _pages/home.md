### Magmatic Temple Bulletin: Proper Deference in Addressing Temple Members
Don't forget to show your elders the appropriate respect, so we can all work together towards the Great Awakening. Please note the following conventions:
- Elders of Ember wear brown hooded robes. They should be greeted in the following manner: "Greetings Great Ember Elder! Hail Zindorg, full of doubt."
- Acolytes of Aa wear tricorn hats. They should be greeted with a deep bow that includes a flourish.
- Icelandic Initiates wear UGG boots and scarves. They should be greeted by the longest hissing sound you can manage, followed by the word 'Hi.'

Welcome our newest Igneous Lava Priests: Bill McGuire, Keith Rowley, Kate Cashman, and Marie Edmonds! Burn bright!
