<p><strong>Zindorg on Taxes</strong>: $13.99 <br>
Did you know that members of the Church of the Magmatic Temple have a First Amendment right to not pay taxes? It is part of our exercise of freedom of religion. The United States IRS try to claim that it is a crime, but we follow the teachings of Zindorg who was also pursued across the galaxy for the “crime” of not turning Zer treasures and skills over to authoritarian forces. This book will teach you about Zindorg’s own practices and how to apply Zer wisdom to your own life.</p>
