<p>Don’t forget to show your elders the appropriate respect, so we can all work together towards the Great Awakening. Please note the following conventions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Elders of Ember wear brown hooded robes. They should be greeted in the following manner: “Greetings Great Ember Elder! Hail Zindorg, full of doubt.”</li>
  <li>Acolytes of Aa wear tricorn hats. They should be greeted with a deep bow that includes a flourish.</li>
  <li>Icelandic Initiates wear UGG boots and scarves. They should be greeted by the longest hissing sound you can manage, followed by the word ‘Hi.’</li>
</ul>

<p>Welcome our newest Igneous Lava Priests: Bill McGuire, Keith Rowley, Kate Cashman, and Marie Edmonds! Burn bright!</p>

<p>We are located at 4334 W. Van Buren Road (the old post office) in the basement suite, Chicago, IL, 60607.</p>
